If the size of the set of objects is very large then an exhaustive search can be very costly. In those cases approximate nearest neighbor techniques can be used. These techniques do not guarantee to find all the nearest neighbors but instead give some probabilistic guaranties. This implies that not all nearest neighbors will be returned and some not so nearest neigbors might appear in the returned list. But the gain is that these methods are much faster than their exhaustive versions.
