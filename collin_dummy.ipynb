However, from a machine learning perspective where the aim is mostly reducing prediction error one might think that multicollinearity is not a problem since it does not effect the prediction power. There is some truth in this. However, if you do not remove highly correlated features your model will not reliable. That is, assuming that you have two highly correlated features, you are learning a plane where actually the data mostly falls in a line.  So, your predictions for points far away from the line will most likely be erroneous.
