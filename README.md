# data_science

This repository contains my implementations of various data science techniques and algorithms. These implementations are not meant to be complete and efficient but have the purpose of giving the basic idea behind the algorithms by providing minimal working versions. Any suggestions or corrections are welcome. 

As an example, 
- the word2vec version in Gensim \footnote{https://github.com/RaRe-Technologies/gensim/blob/develop/gensim/models/word2vec.py} 
contains 2309 lines of code
- the original word2vec \footnote{https://github.com/tmikolov/word2vec/blob/master/word2vec.c} contains 715 lines of code
- my implementation \footnote{https://github.com/tevfikaytekin/data\_science/blob/master/word2vec.ipynb} contains less then 100 lines of code.
