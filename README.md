# data_science

This repository contains my implementations of various data science techniques and algorithms. These implementations are not meant to be complete and efficient but have the purpose of giving the basic idea behind the algorithms by providing minimal working versions. Any suggestions or corrections are welcome. 

As an example comparison, the word2vec version in Gensim https://github.com/RaRe-Technologies/gensim/blob/develop/gensim/models/word2vec.py 
contains 2309 lines of code and the original word2vec implementation https://github.com/tmikolov/word2vec/blob/master/word2vec.c contains 715 lines of code whereas my implementation https://github.com/tevfikaytekin/data\_science/blob/master/word2vec.ipynb contains less then 100 lines of code.
